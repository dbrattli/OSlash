Functors, Applicatives, And Monads in Python
============================================

Ø is a library for playing with functional programming in Python. It's
an attempt to re-implement some of the code from `Learn You a Haskell
for Great Good! <http://learnyouahaskell.com/>`__ in Python 3.4. Ø
unifies functional and object oriented paradigms by grouping related
functions within classes. Objects are however never used for storing
values or mutable data, and data only lives within function closures.

Install
-------

.. code:: bash

    > pip3 install oslash

The project currently contains implementations for:

Abstract Base Classes
---------------------

-  **`Functor <https://github.com/dbrattli/OSlash/wiki/Functors,-Applicatives,-And-Monads-In-Pictures#functors>`__**,
   for stuff that can be mapped
-  **`Applicative <https://github.com/dbrattli/OSlash/wiki/Functors,-Applicatives,-And-Monads-In-Pictures#applicatives>`__**,
   for callable stuff
-  **Monoid**, for associative stuff
-  **`Monad <https://github.com/dbrattli/OSlash/wiki/Functors,-Applicatives,-And-Monads-In-Pictures#monads>`__**,
   for monadic stuff

And Some Monads
---------------

-  **Identity**, boxed stuff in its simplest form
-  **`Maybe (Just \|
   Nothing) <https://github.com/dbrattli/oslash/wiki/Functors,-Applicatives,-And-Monads-In-Pictures>`__**,
   for optional stuff
-  **Either (Right \| Left)**, for possible failures
-  **List**, purely functional list of stuff
-  **`IO
   Action <https://github.com/dbrattli/OSlash/wiki/Functors,-Applicatives,-And-Monads-In-Pictures#io-monad>`__**,
   for impure stuff
-  **`Writer <https://github.com/dbrattli/OSlash/wiki/Three-Useful-Monads#the-writer-monad>`__**,
   for logging stuff
-  **`Reader <https://github.com/dbrattli/OSlash/wiki/Three-Useful-Monads#the-reader-monad>`__**,
   for callable stuff
-  **State**, for stateful computations of stuff
-  **Cont**, for continuation of stuff

Monadic functions
-----------------

-  **>>**, for sequencing monadic actions
-  **lift**, for mapping a function over monadic values
-  **join**, for removing one level of monadic structure
-  **compose**, for composing monadic functions

Utility functions
-----------------

-  **compose**, for composing 0 to n functions

But why?
========

Yes, I know there are other projects out there like
`PyMonad <https://bitbucket.org/jason_delaat/pymonad/>`__,
`fn.py <https://github.com/kachayev/fn.py>`__. I'm simply doing this in
order to better understand the book. It's so much easier to learn when
you implement things yourself. The code may be similar to PyMonad in
structure, but is quite different in implementation.

Why is the project called OSlash? OSlash is the Norwegian character
called `Oslash <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ø>`__. Initially I wanted
to create a project that used Ø and ø (unicode) for the project name and
modules. It didn't work out well, so I renamed it to Oslash.

Examples
--------

Haskell:

.. code:: haskell

    > fmap (+3) (Just 2)
    Just 5

    > (+3) <$> (Just 2)
    Just 5

Python:

.. code:: python

    >>> Just(2).map(lambda x: x+3)
    Just 5

    >>> (lambda x: x+3) % Just(2)
    Just 5

IO Actions:

.. code:: python

    from oslash import put_line, get_line

    main = put_line("What is your name?") | (lambda _:
        get_line() | (lambda name:
        put_line("What is your age?") | (lambda _:
        get_line() | (lambda age:
        put_line("Hello " + name + "!") | (lambda _:
        put_line("You are " + age + " years old"))))))

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
